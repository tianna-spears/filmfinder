This is a project from the Codecademy to practice knowledge of HTTP requests and asynchronous JavaScript to create a movie discovery app that will recommend random movies by genre.

This is Unit 4/5 of the Front-End Developer Career Path.

script.js code was created and built by me. Codecademy provided the html and css files in order for us to practice Javascript.

Thank you for your support! Feel free to check in as I continue to build my developer skills.
